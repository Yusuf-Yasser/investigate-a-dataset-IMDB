## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### Dataset Description
The TMDb movie dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). It includes various attributes such as user ratings, revenue, cast, genres, etc. Some key points about the dataset:

- Certain columns like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’ contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column, which are not cleaned.
- The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

### Questions for Analysis
In this project, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. Which year has the highest release of movies?
2. Which year has the highest profit rate?
3. What is the average runtime of movies from year to year?
4. Which genres are most popular from year to year?

## Data Wrangling <a name="data-wrangling"></a>

### General Properties
We begin by loading the dataset into a DataFrame, dropping irrelevant columns, checking for missing values, and replacing/filling them.

### Data Cleaning
- Duplicates are checked and removed.
- The release date column is converted to datetime format.
- Unused columns such as 'imdb_id', 'homepage', 'tagline', 'overview', 'budget_adj', and 'revenue_adj' are dropped.
- Rows with missing values in 'cast' and 'genres' columns are removed.
- Rows with 0 values in the 'budget' and 'revenue' columns are removed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis <a name="exploratory-data-analysis"></a>

### Research Question 1: Which year has the highest release of movies?
We group the data by release year and count the number of movies released each year. The analysis shows that the year 2011 had the highest number of movie releases.

### Research Question 2: Which year has the highest profit rate?
We calculate the profit for each movie and analyze the average profit per year. The analysis reveals that the years 2014-2016 were the most profitable.

### Research Question 3: Which Genre Has The Highest Release Of Movies?
We analyze the count of movies for each genre to identify the most popular genre. Drama emerges as the genre with the highest number of movies.

### Research Question 4: Which genres are most popular from year to year?
We explore the popularity of genres over the years by standardizing the data and plotting the most popular genres annually. The analysis highlights shifts in genre popularity over time.

## Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>

1. The year 2011 had the highest number of movie releases.
2. The profit generated by movies increased significantly in recent years.
3. Drama is the most popular genre, followed by action, comedy, and thriller.
4. Genre popularity varies from year to year, with drama dominating in some years and action in others.

### Limitations
- During data cleaning, some movies with zero budgets and revenues were filtered out, potentially affecting the accuracy of the analysis regarding the number of movies released in a year.
